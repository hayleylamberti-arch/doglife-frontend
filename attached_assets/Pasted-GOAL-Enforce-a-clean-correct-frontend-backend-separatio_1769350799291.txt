GOAL: Enforce a clean, correct frontend/backend separation (Option A).

CONTEXT (IMPORTANT):
- This repository has BOTH backend and frontend code.
- The frontend must live ONLY in `doglife-frontend/`.
- The backend must remain OUTSIDE `doglife-frontend/`.
- There must be NO duplicate `src/` folders at the repo root.

TARGET ARCHITECTURE (MANDATORY):

/home/runner/workspace/        ← Git repo root (syncs with GitHub)
│
├─ server/                     ← Backend (Node / API / server code)
│
├─ doglife-frontend/           ← Frontend ONLY (Vite + React)
│  ├─ package.json
│  ├─ vite.config.ts
│  ├─ tsconfig.json
│  ├─ index.html
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ App.tsx
│  │  ├─ Routes.tsx
│  │  ├─ components/
│  │  ├─ hooks/
│  │  ├─ pages/
│  │  ├─ lib/
│  │  ├─ types/
│  │  └─ utils/
│  └─ dist/                    ← build output only
│
└─ (NO /src folder at repo root)

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
1. `doglife-frontend/` is the ONLY frontend project
2. All React, Vite, Tailwind, and UI files must live under `doglife-frontend/src`
3. Backend code must NOT be moved into `doglife-frontend`
4. `/home/runner/workspace/src` MUST NOT EXIST
5. `dist/` must NEVER be treated as source code
6. Git history must NOT delete backend files

TASKS:
1. Verify the current filesystem against the target architecture
2. If frontend files exist outside `doglife-frontend/`, MOVE them into `doglife-frontend/src`
3. If duplicate frontend files exist, KEEP ONLY the `doglife-frontend` versions
4. Ensure `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, and `index.html` are present in `doglife-frontend`
5. Ensure Vite builds successfully from `doglife-frontend`
6. Ensure backend folders remain untouched
7. Ensure there is exactly ONE frontend source tree

VERIFICATION (YOU MUST OUTPUT THIS):
- A tree view of `doglife-frontend/`
- Confirmation that `/home/runner/workspace/src` does NOT exist
- `npm run build` result from inside `doglife-frontend`
- Clear confirmation that frontend and backend are cleanly separated

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT create a monorepo
- DO NOT merge frontend into backend
- DO NOT change deployment strategy
- DO NOT delete backend code
- This setup MUST be compatible with Vercel using:
  Root Directory: doglife-frontend
  Build Command: npm run build
  Output Directory: dist

Proceed carefully and explain each structural change you make.
