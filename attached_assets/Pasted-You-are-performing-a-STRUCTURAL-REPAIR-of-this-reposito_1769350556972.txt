You are performing a STRUCTURAL REPAIR of this repository.
This is a PRODUCTION-BOUND project. Do not improvise.

GOAL (MANDATORY):
Normalize the repository so that there is ONLY ONE frontend source tree:
    /home/runner/workspace/doglife-frontend/

The frontend must be fully self-contained and deployable to Vercel.
The duplicate source directory at /home/runner/workspace/src MUST NOT exist afterward.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITICAL RULES (READ CAREFULLY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. DO NOT delete files unless explicitly instructed.
2. DO NOT create duplicate source trees.
3. DO NOT move backend code into the frontend.
4. DO NOT modify build logic unless required for correctness.
5. DO NOT claim changes were made unless git status proves it.
6. ALL file operations must be real, not hypothetical.
7. The final state must pass:
   - npm run build
   - npx tsc --noEmit
   - git status (clean after commit)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CURRENT PROBLEM TO FIX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
There are TWO frontend source trees:

❌ /home/runner/workspace/src
✅ /home/runner/workspace/doglife-frontend/src

Replit AI previously edited /workspace/src, which is NOT the deploy target.
Vercel builds from doglife-frontend/.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REQUIRED ACTIONS (IN ORDER)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1 — VERIFY ROOTS
- Confirm that /home/runner/workspace is the Git repository root.
- Confirm that doglife-frontend/ is the intended frontend project.

STEP 2 — MIGRATE SOURCE CODE (NO DELETIONS YET)
- Move ALL frontend source files from:
    /home/runner/workspace/src/*
  INTO:
    /home/runner/workspace/doglife-frontend/src/

- Preserve directory structure:
  components/, hooks/, pages/, lib/, types/, assets/, styles, etc.

- If files already exist in doglife-frontend/src:
  - Prefer the NEWER, fully typed versions
  - Merge carefully, do NOT overwrite blindly

STEP 3 — VERIFY FRONTEND COMPLETENESS
Ensure doglife-frontend/ contains:
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
- vite.config.ts
- index.html
- src/

If any are missing, FIX them.

STEP 4 — DELETE DUPLICATE SOURCE TREE
ONLY AFTER STEP 3 PASSES:
- Delete /home/runner/workspace/src completely

STEP 5 — BUILD VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)
Run from doglife-frontend/:
- npm install (if needed)
- npx tsc --noEmit
- npm run build

STOP if any errors occur and FIX THEM.

STEP 6 — GIT HYGIENE (MANDATORY)
- Show git status BEFORE commit
- Commit with message:
  "Normalize frontend structure and remove duplicate source tree"
- Show git status AFTER commit (must be clean)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
At the end, report ONLY:
1. Final directory tree for doglife-frontend/
2. Confirmation that /home/runner/workspace/src no longer exists
3. Build results (tsc + vite)
4. git status output

DO NOT provide explanations.
DO NOT speculate.
DO NOT skip steps.
