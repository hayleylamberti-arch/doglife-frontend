You are working in the doglife-frontend repository (frontend-only Vite + React + TypeScript project deployed to Vercel).

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Vercel production build fails during `tsc && vite build`
- Errors come from `src/pages/profile-backup.tsx`
- This file is a backup / unused file and should NOT be part of the production build
- Replit previously fixed similar issues by removing unused backup files

GOALS:
1. Ensure `npm run build` passes locally
2. Ensure Vercel production build passes
3. Do NOT break any actively routed pages
4. Do NOT modify backend code
5. Do NOT introduce new features

TASKS (DO THESE IN ORDER):

1. Identify all backup, unused, or legacy files that should not be compiled:
   - Files with names like `*-backup.tsx`, `*-old.tsx`, `*.disabled.tsx`
   - Especially `src/pages/profile-backup.tsx`

2. Verify which pages are actually used:
   - Check `App.tsx`, routing configuration, and imports
   - Confirm which pages are actively referenced

3. For unused backup files:
   - Either DELETE them safely
   - OR move them outside `src/` so TypeScript does not compile them
   - Do NOT leave broken JSX inside `src/`

4. Ensure TypeScript configuration is correct:
   - `tsconfig.json` should only include valid source files
   - No backup files should be included in compilation

5. Run and verify:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run build`
   - Confirm `tsc && vite build` completes successfully with no errors

6. Commit the fix:
   - Use a clear commit message like:
     "Remove unused backup files causing Vercel build failure"

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- This is a Vite project (not Next.js)
- Output directory must remain `dist`
- Environment variables are already configured in Vercel
- Root directory in Vercel is correct and empty (repo root)

FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- A clean build with zero TypeScript errors
- No backup files inside `src/`
- Confirmation that the frontend is ready for Vercel deployment

Proceed carefully and systematically. Do not guess — verify before deleting.
